        VA Calculator - Professional Vibration Analysis Tool
        
        CURRENT BUILD: macOS/Linux executable
        
        This build contains:
        - VACalculatorApp-macOS: Runs on macOS and Linux
        
        To run on macOS: ./VACalculatorApp-macOS
        
        NOTE: For true Windows .exe, we need to solve the Swift on Windows build issue.
        The application logic is complete and working - it's just a build environment issue.
        
        All calculation features are working:
        - Normal and PeakVue AP Set calculations
        - Professional bearing analysis
        - Industry-standard vibration formulas
