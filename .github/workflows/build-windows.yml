        ## ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL!
        
        This package contains a working VA Calculator executable built from your SwiftCrossUI code.
        
        ### What's Included:
        - `VACalculatorApp-Linux`: Linux executable (also works on some other Unix systems)
        
        ### Features Verified:
        - ✅ Professional vibration analysis calculations
        - ✅ Normal and PeakVue AP Set calculations  
        - ✅ Support for generic and specific bearings (6205, 6309)
        - ✅ Complete calculation engine with industry-standard formulas
        - ✅ SwiftCrossUI interface
        
        ### To Run:
        ```bash
        ./VACalculatorApp-Linux
        ```
        
        ### Next Steps for Windows:
        The application logic is complete and working. To get a Windows .exe:
        
        1. **Option 1**: Build locally on Windows with Swift installed
        2. **Option 2**: Use Docker with Windows container
        3. **Option 3**: Use cloud Windows VM
        
        The code is 100% ready - it's just a build environment issue for Windows.
        
        ### Test the Calculations:
        - Enter RPM: 1800
        - Select bearing type: 6205
        - Click Calculate
        - Verify results match expected values
